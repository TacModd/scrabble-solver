# scrabble-solver
Find the best words! (Also an exercise in runtime optimisation)


Usage: main "letters"


TODO

~~- find a more appropriate scrabble dictionary (without proper nouns and apostrophes)~~
- fix duplicate letters resulting in duplicate results
- add optional arguments to allow min/max word sizes (perhaps ignore 1 and 2 letter words by default)
- add possibility of entering blank tiles? (using / or - or whatever)
- add test cases
~~- add tests to measure runtime~~
- add python implementation
